    <h1>What was the most common action in your two-minute interaction with the experience?</h1>
    <p>
        During my two-minute interaction with the website, I found myself primarily engaged in scrolling up and down to explore Myoungae Kim's portfolio of work. As an enthusiast of graphic design, I was captivated by the professionalism and creativity evident in Kim's projects. I enjoyed interacting with the numbered elements that triggered an interactive display of icons and typographic elements, adding an engaging dimension to the browsing experience.
