    <h1>What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you, and what makes that part frustrating?</h1>
    <p>
        The most frustrating aspect of the interaction was the left-side bar, which may not be optimised for all screen sizes. On certain displays, Kim's contact details extend beyond the visible area, preventing users from accessing the complete information without resizing the window or navigating to a different section. This limitation disrupts the otherwise seamless browsing experience and could potentially detract from user satisfaction.
