    <h1>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time?</h1>
    <p>
        My impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time is positive. The website's interactive aesthetic strikes a delicate balance, offering engagement without overwhelming the user. Its minimalistic design effectively directs attention to Kim's work, making it an impactful showcase of their skills that remains relevant and timeless.
